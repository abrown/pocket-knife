<!-- JUSTIFICATION -->
<h2>JUSTIFICATION</h2>
<p>
    Everyone wants an API. Everyone wants "the cloud". Everyone wants everything:
    the socially-connected, any-device-ready, beautifully-styled, 100%-code-covered
    web application. And they want an app for it.
</p>
<p>
    It seems obvious that all of these wishes are not concurrently possible. It takes
    time and effort to build solid applications. I realized this most acutely when I
    decided to do some freelancing on Elance (you can see my profile 
    <a href="https://www.elance.com/s/andrewsbrown">here</a>); no matter how I would
    explain it, many customers would fall victim to the tech hype. A recent example: a 
    job posting started off with "this website is meant for social business" (is not
    all business social?) and ended with "the desired functionality is similar to 
    elance.com, however not as complicated" (does this seem ironic to anyone else?).
</p>
<p>
    The problem is that some of the hype is true: good programmers <i>can</i> build 
    wonderful creations by leveraging code re-use and good architectures. The key is
    a framework: a code library that takes care of the routine so that the programmer
    can focus on the creative.

    I built <code>pocket-knife</code> for several reasons, but mainly to speed up
    my work on web services. I read an article about Daniel Jacobson
    (<a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/hack/2012/02/netflix-daniel-jacobson-lettin.php">
    read here</a> and the frameworks behind NPR and Netflix--they were both "Create
    Once, Publish Everywhere" systems. I read about RESTful web services and was
    convinced--it made sense in an HTTP-ish way. I used CakePHP extensively for some
    projects and was frustrated by being forced to learn the CakePHP way. I used Magento 
    (just once, fortunately) and realized that an MVC architecture could be 
    overkill--I mean, I just needed a shopping cart.
</p>
<p>
    So I made <code>pocket-knife</code> to do one thing well: frame up web services.
    Create an endpoint (<a href="">tutorial</a>), configure the service 
    (<a href="">tutorial</a>), code the logic (<a href="">tutorial</a>)
    and use it (<a href="">tutorial</a>). Use it with any content type, any device,
    any database, and any server environment.
