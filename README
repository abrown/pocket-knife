pocket-knife
------------

pocket-knife is a mini-framework for making sites and services. It is fast
and simple. It is RESTful. It is minimal. It is a collection of the tools I use
every day to make web development easy.

By all means, contribute: if the framework does not contain that one perfect
function, the fabled master-class, or some other construct you deem necessary to
PHP life, please commit freely to https://github.com/andrewsbrown/pocket-knife.
